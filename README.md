# 🎮 Gesture Gaming: Where Technology Meets Fun

A real-time gesture-controlled gaming system using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe** to interact with browser-based games via hand movements, offering a fun and contactless gameplay experience.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project leverages computer vision to recognize hand gestures captured through a webcam and simulates corresponding keyboard inputs. It replaces traditional keyboard controls with intuitive hand gestures to control characters in online games like **Subway Surfers**, **Temple Run**, and more.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Replace keyboard input with hand gestures for controlling browser games.
- Create a touchless, interactive gaming experience.
- Explore the potential of real-time computer vision and gesture recognition.

---

## 💡 Features

- Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe
- Gesture recognition with OpenCV
- Simulated key presses using PyAutoGUI
- Customizable gesture mapping
- Simple and intuitive user interface

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Python** | Core programming language |
| **OpenCV** | Video capture and image processing |
| **MediaPipe** | Hand detection and tracking |
| **PyAutoGUI** | Keyboard press simulation |
| **NumPy** | Math operations |
| **cv2 (OpenCV GUI)** | To display video feed |

---

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- Python 3.7 or above
- Webcam (internal/external)
- Browser-based games (Subway Surfers recommended)

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui numpy
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Open the game (e.g., [Subway Surfers](https://subwaysurfers.online/)) in your browser.
2. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python gesture.py
    ```
3. Focus the game window.
4. Use your hand to control the character with gestures.
5. Press **'q'** to quit the program.

## ✋ Gesture Mapping

| Gesture          | Action                 |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Hand Up          | Jump (Up Arrow)        |
| Hand Down        | Slide (Down Arrow)     |
| Left Tilt        | Move Left              |
| Right Tilt       | Move Right             |
| Open Palm        | Use Ability / Spacebar |

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Voice + gesture hybrid control
- Multi-hand detection support
- Full-body gesture control
- AR/VR integration
